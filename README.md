This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Trying out new libraries to evaluate ease of use.

Tried 3 different libraries:

[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
[Grommet](https://grommet.io)
[PrimeReact](https://primefaces.org/primereact)

Current "active" library: Material-UI 

Run `npm install` on master to ensure all the used libraries are installed

To switch between the POCs (for cleaner code and laziness of not making multiple pages and a dropdown selector) switch
 between the branches. 
 Material UI - master
 Grommet - Grommet
 PrimeReact - PrimeReact
 
### What was done to evaluate the libraries.

* Create a login form
* Create a nav Header with 2 layers, one for Logo + Logout, one for Application Name + NavBar
  * NavBar should have a highlight effect and 'active' state
* Login form submit would NOT do anything but open a modal with some content inside.
* Apply color scheme and customizations to the default libraries
